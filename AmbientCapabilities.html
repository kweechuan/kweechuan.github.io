    Earlier, I got really puzzled how did splunk forwarder, running as splunk user, gets to read a file owned by root. Typically, thought the userid splunk would be granted the persmission, for example, by adding splunk userid in /etc/group, or chmod with read permission all the way to the file.
    <p/>
    The easy way to check/test is to su to splunk user, and attempt to read the file.  Result: The file is not "reachable" nor "readable". facl is not used as well.
    <p/>
    So something else is at work here.
    <pre>
$ less /etc/systemd/system/SplunkForwarder.service
:
AmbientCapabilities=CAP_DAC_READ_SEARCH
:
    </pre>
    <pre>
# cat /proc/5490/status | grep Cap
CapInh: 0000000000000004
CapPrm: 0000000000000004
CapEff: 0000000000000004
CapBnd: 000001ffffffffff
CapAmb: 0000000000000004
    </pre>
